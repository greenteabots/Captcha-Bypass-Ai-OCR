My issues with this: Zefoy uses a cooldown on video id's, thus using proxies is useless as it is not ip based.

Changes:
      Chrome error due to bad proxy = close tab (not sure if this saved but dont care)
      Changed inputs in python script "start.py" so you don't have to input it everytime (personal preference)
      
      
      
      
Possible future fixes (not doing these since this script is not useful): 
      Print current proxy being used
      Close tab on ngix error caused by bad proxy
      Remove bad proxies from list after being detected
      Script will do captcha, click video, insert link, but will not hit search or the video bot starter.
